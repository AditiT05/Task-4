# Task-4
This is a responsive website for ACRYLIC – Kids Art Center built using HTML and CSS. It includes a header, hero section, class cards, information section, and a footer with a contact form and social media icons. The design is colorful and child-friendly.
The website was converted from a desktop layout to a mobile-friendly layout using CSS media queries (@media (max-width: 768px)). I used Flexbox and Grid to adjust layouts, resize images, stack sections vertically, and improve responsiveness for smaller screens.
Through this project, I learned responsive web design, media queries, Flexbox, Grid, and modern CSS styling techniques.
